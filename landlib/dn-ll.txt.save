	===========================
	What we do already have?

	All the libraries here are independent each other,
	all everyone can call the kernel.

	kernel < rtl < process
	kernel < rtl < libcore < process
	kernel < rtl < libgws  < process 

	================================

	libgws:
	>> run on top of rtl.
	>> run on top of libco
