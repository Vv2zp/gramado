I will create some red pills programs that will change the setup files for a new initialization for testing not well tested new features.
So, this way i can share with the community a well tested version of the system, and the developers can activate the new features simply running the red pill application.
I'm not sure about that ... i'm still learning the concept ... but i like the idea of having a consistent interface to help the people to learn how to use the system.
